## Project Overview

This project implements a robust, reproducible classification pipeline following engineering best practices. The workflow is separated into two phases:

1. **Engineering Phase**: Building a solid, automated Python script (`train_model.py`)
2. **Documentation Phase**: Creating interactive documentation (`documentation.ipynb`)

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Production Ready! See [Proof of Completion](docs/project-management/PROOF_OF_COMPLETION.md)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anupamabhay/classification-model.git
cd classification-model

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run with Sample Data (Ready to Go!)
The project includes sample data, so you can run it immediately:
```bash
# Run the automated training pipeline
python train_model.py

# Or explore interactively with Jupyter
jupyter notebook documentation.ipynb
```

### 3. Use Your Own Data
- Replace `data/source_data.csv` with your CSV file
- Ensure it has a 'target' column for binary classification
- The script automatically detects numerical/categorical features

### 4. View Results
- Check `output/` folder for model artifacts and metrics
- Open `documentation.ipynb` in Jupyter for detailed analysis
- Read `docs/technical/TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md` for complete technical details

## Development Methodology

This project follows a **script-first development approach**:

1. **Engineering First**: Build robust, tested Python script
2. **Documentation Second**: Create presentation notebook
3. **Version Control**: Systematic git workflow with branches
4. **Production Ready**: Logging, error handling, modularity

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Settings
Edit constants in `train_model.py`:
```python
DATA_PATH = Path('./data/your_file.csv')
TARGET_COLUMN = 'your_target_column'
TEST_SIZE = 0.3  # 70/30 split
RANDOM_STATE = 123
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning
The pipeline is designed to be easily extended:
```python
# In build_pipeline() function
XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=200,
    max_depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    random_state=RANDOM_STATE
)
```

## Deployment

The trained model can be deployed using:
```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('output/model.joblib')
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions.
