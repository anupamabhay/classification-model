## Project Objectives - ACHIEVED

### Primary Goals

  - **Production-Ready Classification Pipeline**: A complete end-to-end system was implemented.
  - **Automated Preprocessing**: The system handles mixed data types automatically.
  - **Professional Code Quality**: Adheres to standards including type hints, logging, error handling, and documentation.
  - **Reproducible Results**: Fixed random seeds ensure consistent outputs.
  - **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Includes multiple metrics with visualization.

### Technical Requirements

  - **Modular Architecture**: Built with 8 functions, each having a single responsibility.
  - **XGBoost Implementation**: Utilizes an optimized gradient boosting classifier.
  - **Pipeline Pattern**: Prevents data leakage and ensures reproducible preprocessing.
  - **Performance Metrics**: Calculates Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score with weighted averages.
  - **Output Generation**: Produces model artifacts, a metrics JSON file, and a confusion matrix visualization.
