## File Purposes & Responsibilities

### Core Implementation Files

  - **`train_model.py`**: The main production script - modular, logged, and type-hinted.
  - **`requirements.txt`**: Pinned dependencies for creating reproducible environments.
  - **`documentation.ipynb`**: An interactive presentation of the model's results and analysis.

### Data Management

  - **`data/source_data.csv`**: The user-provided training dataset (required for execution).
  - **`output/model.joblib`**: The complete trained pipeline, ready for deployment.
  - **`output/performance_metrics.json`**: Machine-readable evaluation metrics.
  - **`output/plots/confusion_matrix.png`**: A visual assessment of the model's performance.

### Documentation Hierarchy

  - **`README.md`**: The main entry point for users, covering setup, usage, and features.
  - **`docs/technical/TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md`**: A complete technical deep-dive into the project's architecture.
  - **`docs/project-management/plans.md`**: The development roadmap and technical specifications.
  - **`docs/project-management/checklist.md`**: Used for progress tracking and status updates.
  - **`DEPLOYMENT.md`**: Instructions for deploying the model into a production environment.

### Development Infrastructure

  - **`.gitignore`**: Contains professional exclusions to keep the repository clean (e.g., `venv/`, `output/`, IDE files).
  - **`venv/`**: The isolated Python environment with exact package versions.

## Workflow & Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow

1.  **Setup**: `python -m venv venv` followed by `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2.  **Data**: Place the training CSV file at `data/source_data.csv`.
3.  **Training**: Run `python train_model.py`.
4.  **Analysis**: Open `documentation.ipynb` to view and interact with the results.
5.  **Details**: Read `docs/technical/TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md` for a full explanation of the system.

### File Interaction Flow

```
source_data.csv -> train_model.py -> {model.joblib, metrics.json, confusion_matrix.png}
                               |
                               v
      documentation.ipynb -> loads artifacts for presentation
                               |
                               v
      TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md -> explains the entire system architecture
```

### Git Workflow

  - **`main` Branch**: Stable releases with a complete `README.md`.
  - **`dev` Branch**: Active development with the latest features.
  - **Documentation**: Continuously updated in the `docs/` folder.
  - **Releases**: Tagged versions are created with corresponding deployment guides.

## Documentation Strategy

### Three-Tier Documentation Approach

#### Tier 1: User-Facing (`README.md`)

  - Quick start and basic usage.
  - Feature overview and benefits.
  - Installation and setup instructions.
  - Links to more detailed documentation.

#### Tier 2: Technical Deep-Dive (`docs/technical/TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md`)

  - Complete architecture analysis.
  - Code structure and design decisions.
  - Algorithm explanations and data flow diagrams.
  - Interview preparation talking points.

#### Tier 3: Project Management (`docs/project-management/`)

  - Development methodology and philosophy.
  - Technical specifications and roadmap.
  - Progress tracking and success metrics.
  - Future enhancement planning.

### Documentation Maintenance

  - **Living Documents**: Updated with each new feature.
  - **Version Synchronization**: Docs always match the code implementation.
  - **User Feedback**: Continuously improved based on usage patterns.
  - **Technical Accuracy**: Validated against the actual implementation.

-----

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards

  - **Type Hints**: All functions have proper type annotations.
  - **Docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation for all functions.
  - **Logging**: Professional logging throughout the execution path.
  - **Error Handling**: Robust exception management.
  - **Modularity**: Adherence to the single-responsibility principle for functions.

### Documentation Quality

  - **Completeness**: Every component is thoroughly explained.
  - **Accuracy**: The documentation correctly reflects the implementation.
  - **Clarity**: Written to be accessible to different skill levels.
  - **Structure**: Features logical organization and navigation.
  - **Examples**: Includes practical usage demonstrations.

### Project Organization Benefits

  - **Scalability**: A clear structure that supports future growth.
  - **Maintainability**: Components are easy to locate and update.
  - **Collaboration**: A team-friendly organization.
  - **Professional Standards**: Follows industry best practices.
  - **Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive documentation allows for easy handoff.
